I'm currently in year 13 attending Garin College in Nelson. My programming journey started in 2020 when I fell in love with creating websites, Since then I have been growing my web development skills. However, I have also experimented with game and app development. I am currently working full-time in school to prepare for university next year where I plan to take a software development course. <br><br> I dabble in photography some of which you can see here.
